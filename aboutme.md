Hi, I'm Aditya Iyengar and this is my personal webpage.
I am a second year undergraduate student at **IIT Bombay**. My major is in [**Mechanical Engineering**](me.iitb.ac.in).
I also play Scrabble at the international level.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
