Hi, I'm Aditya Iyengar and this is my personal webpage.

I am a second year undergraduate student at **IIT Bombay**. My major is in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in).
I'm currently pursuing minors in [Systems and Control Engineering](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in) as well as [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in).

I play Scrabble at the international level. You can find my all-time Scrabble tournament record [here](https://wespa.org/aardvark/cgi-bin/statsbootstrap.cgi?name1=Aditya%20Iyengar).

I also like to cycle and listen to music.
