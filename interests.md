- I am currently working on designing a **Fluid Flow Calibration System** at the THTF Lab, IIT Bombay.
- I am one of two students nominated by IIT Bombay to attend the [Summer University 2020](https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/Incoming-students/Summer-University) programme at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/).
- I've created a cool Initial Value Differential Equation Solver that you can find [here](MA_214_Code_Snippets.ipynb). [Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AplMvJAHl-Jf4n7aue7hspnsxFw3YVMm#scrollTo=I3Lq48ZVzuB-) is a direct link to the Colab version which makes it easier to play around with. Still working on a front-end.
- Being the massive football fan that I am, I'm also working on a **machine learning powered model** to predict the Premier League standings. I'll soon be posting stuff that I do related to this project.
- I was also a part of [IIT Bombay Racing](https://www.iitbracing.org/) - the institute's award-winning Formula Student Team - where I studied three modules, namely *High Voltage Safety*, *System Integration* and *Controller Area Network*.
