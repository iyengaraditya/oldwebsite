I am currently working on designing a 'Fluid Flow Calibration System' at the THTF Lab, IIT Bombay.

Here are a few more interesting things I have done over the course of my stay at IIT Bombay.
- **Teaching Assistant** for the course **ME 119: Engineering Graphics and Drawing** for the Spring Term 2020. My role includes reviewing problem sets to be supplied to students, solving and subsequently grading them, all on a weekly basis.
- **Teaching Assistant** for the course **MA 108: Ordinary Differential Equations** for the Summer Term 2019. This position entailed mentoring and conducting tutorial sessions for a batch of 20 academically underperforming students over three weeks and grading weekly quizzes and an end-semester exam.
- Worked as a trainee in the Electrical Subdivision for [**IIT Bombay Racing**](https://www.iitbracing.org) - the institute's award-winning Formula Student Team. Studied three modules, namely *High Voltage Safety*, *System Integration* and *Controller Area Network*.
